Its a sad day, 8 weeks of great lessons with great teachers, it has been really fun. Thanks alot trainers and personal at the coders guild. o/ 

I finished this course with a brilliant company with brilliant trainers, to be interacting with the trainers, other trainees and the course itself has been very fun and enlightening. Thank you so much to The Coders Guild! All the best!

Looking forward to my future endeavours :)
